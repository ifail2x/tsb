<h1><strong>My message to Trinity School Belvedere</strong></h1>
<p>I'm sorry Trinity School Belvedere, but your &quot;behaviour management system&quot; makes me want to commit suicide. Mind you this isn't the only time that I've considered suicide thanks to this school's rubbish. Because the social media exposure (not just of me, but other students) I no longer feel safe. I've had friends turn on me because you cant fix your sh*t. I've complained about this rubbish before, and this time, I just need to get this message out. Thanks to you, I have to use my knowledge of HTML to put this on a website.</p>
<p>You are saying you have a SEN Department, but you can't f*cking protect your autistic students.</p>
<p><strong>Repariere deine Schei√üe, oder ich mache es</strong></p>
